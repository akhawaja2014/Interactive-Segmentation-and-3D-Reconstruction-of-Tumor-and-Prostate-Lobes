Human Body is the most fantastic and perfect machine.
 The more we learn it, the more we are surprised.
 It's a perfectly designed system comprising of different sub-systems.
 These subsystems comprising of different organ systems work together in
 a complex, dynamic and efficient manner for its perfect health.

The prostate is one of the important body part , its a walnut-sized gland
 located between the bladder and the penis.
 The prostate is just in front of the rectum.
 The urethra runs through the center of the prostate, from the bladder to
 the penis, letting urine flow out of the body.
 The prostate secretes fluid that nourishes and protects sperm.
 During ejaculation, the prostate squeezes this fluid into the urethra,
 and it’s expelled with sperm as semen.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men.
 Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate
 gland, where it may not cause serious harm.
 However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal
 or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not clear what causes prostate cancer.
 Doctors know that prostate cancer begins when some cells in your prostate
 become abnormal.
 Mutations in the abnormal cells' DNA cause the cells to grow and divide
 more rapidly than normal cells do.
 The abnormal cells continue living, when other cells would die.
 The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby
 tissue.
 Some abnormal cells can also break off and spread (metastasize) to other
 parts of the body

Anatomy of Prostate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prostate is the largest accessory gland in the male reproductive system.
 The prostate is positioned inferiorly to the neck of the bladder and superiorly
 to the external urethral sphincter, with the levator ani muscle lying inferolat
erally to the gland

The prostate is commonly described as being the size of a walnut.
 Roughly two-thirds of the prostate is glandular in structure and the remaining
 third is fibromuscular.
 The gland itself is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule of the prostate.
 This is not a real capsule; it rather resembles the thin connective tissue
 known as adventitia in the large blood vessels.
 The prostate is divided into three zones

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Central zone
\series default
 – surrounds the ejaculatory ducts, comprising approximately 25% of normal
 prostate volume.
 The ducts of the glands from the central zone are obliquely emptying in
 the prostatic urethra, thus being rather immune to urine reflux.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Transitional zone
\series default
 – located centrally and surrounds the urethra, comprising approximately
 5-10% of normal prostate volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Peripheral zone
\series default
 – makes up the main body of the gland (approximately 65%) and is located
 posteriorly.
 The ducts of the glands from the peripheral zone are vertically emptying
 in the prostatic urethra; that may explain the tendency of these glands
 to permit urine reflux.
 That also explains the high incidence of acute and chronic inflammation
 found in these compartments, a fact that may be linked to the high incidence
 of prostate carcinoma at the peripheral zone.
 The peripheral zone is mainly the area felt against the rectum on Digital
 Rectal Examinations (DRE), which is of irreplaceable value.

The arterial supply to the prostate comes from the prostatic arteries, which
 are mainly derived from the internal iliac arteries.
 Some branches may also arise from the internal pudendal and middle rectal
 arteries

Venous drainage of the prostate is via the prostatic venous plexus, draining
 into the internal iliac veins.
 However, the prostatic venous plexus also connects posteriorly by networks
 of veins, including the Batson venous plexus, to the internal vertebral
 venous plexus

The prostate receives sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory innervation
 from the inferior hypogastric plexus.
 The smooth muscle of the prostate gland is innervated by sympathetic fibres,
 which activate during ejaculation.

Prostatic carcinoma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is most commonly diagnosed cancer among men.
 The malignant cells commonly originate from the peripheral zone, although
 carcinomas may arise (more rarely) from the central and transition zones
 too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However the proximity of the peripheral zone to the neurovascular bundle
 that surrounds the prostate may facilitate spread along perineural and
 lymphatic pathways, thus increasing the metastatic potential of these tumors.
 Malignant cells may invade adjacent structures (bladder, seminal vesicles)
 and/ or lymphatic and blood vessel routes to give distant

 We were given task to deal with an adenocarcinoma type of cancer for prostate.
 It is a type of cancer that arises in the cells of glands.
 Most cells in the prostate gland are of the glandular type, which means
 that adenocarcinoma is the most common type of cancer to occur in the prostate.
 Cancer occurs when the genes of a cell become abnormal (mutation), causing
 the cell to multiply and interfere with the normal function of a tissue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the cancer reaches a certain size, the abnormal cells can spread to
 other parts of the body and cause cancerous tumours to grow.
 This phenomenon is known as metastasis.
 If a tumour is capable of spreading to other parts of the body in this
 way, it is called malignant.
 Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is malignant, however many types grow extremely
 slowly, and so are unlikely to spread before a man dies of other causes

Active Contour Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter covers the most important concept of the project which is the
 algorithm we used to segment the prostate images.
 It is important to understand the algorithm in order to fully understand
 the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active contour model is also known as snakes.
 It is very popular among Computer Vision community.
 This algorithm has enormous applications from Autonomous driving cars to
 medical imaging.
 It is one of very reliable and easy to implement algorithm available.
 Snake is an energy minimizing algorithm, which means it works on some optimizat
ion technique to find the minimum energy.
 We need an energy function, that matches our intuition about how good the
 segmentation is.

 and how to think about energy in order to understand.
