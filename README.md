# Semi Automatic Segmentation of Prostate
 Prostate cancer is most common cancer among men. There has been a lot of
research to detect the cancer at the earliest possible stage. A number of meth-
ods are available and used to detect tumor, but scientific community is always
curious to and a compuationally cheap, reliable, robust and more accurate seg-
mentation of prostate. This project proposes semi automatic segmentation of
different zones of prostate as well as tumor using Active Contour Model. The
project starts with GUI explanation, code structure, brief introduction of Prostate and discusses related biological
pre-requisites to understand the aim of the project. We then describes
active contour model and theory behind to let reader's know how it works.
The algorithm is implemented on MATLAB and an application is created.

area of interest is Interactive segmentation of Medical Images, Image registration and Control theory. 
## User Guide
The application was built on MATLAB app designer. It is relatively new
platform and is different from GUIDE. App Designer is an interactive develop-
ment environment for designing an app layout and programming its behavior.
Now lets start with the aplication. When you run the program the following
figure will appear in the screen.

To upload the images, we use the button Load image folder in yellow colour.
It will load the whole folder of dicom images in our database. Select the database
you want to open. Donot select folder with other formats exept Dicom. This
button is not programmed to work for other image types. The purple color but-
tons with next and previous images written on them will navigate you through
different slices / instances of MRI. The data will change accordingly.
